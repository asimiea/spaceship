# simple game where a spaceship blasts asteroids in space

Not done yet.
This is what it looks like now.

Asteroids, extra player lives and shooting have been added but I haven't added the collisions. :(

And i can't make the bullet to be continuous when i fire a new one

Need to add collisions ASAP!
